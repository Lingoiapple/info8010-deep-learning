## Last words

- Deep Learning is more than feedforward networks.
- It is a .bold[methodology]:
  - assemble networks of parameterized functional blocks 
  - train them from examples using some form of gradient-based optimisation.
- Bricks are simple, but their nested composition can be arbitrarily complicated.
- Think like an architect: make cathedrals!
